# Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Data Science Job Simulation
**CommonwealthBank_DataScience:** <br>
I completed the Commonwealth Bank Data Science job simulation on Forage, where I created data engineering pipelines to extract valuable insights from datasets. I learned data anonymization for privacy compliance and designed optimized databases. This experience enhanced my skills in data analysis, database design, and ensuring data privacy.

**Repository Overview:**  
This repository showcases my experience in Commonwealth Bank's Introduction to Data Science job simulation on the Forage platform. During this simulation, I worked on a data engineering project where I aggregated datasets, extracted valuable insights, and ensured compliance with data privacy regulations. I also designed and optimized databases for efficient data management and analysis.

**Simulation Highlights:**  

1. **Data Engineering Pipeline Development**  
   - Created data engineering pipelines to aggregate and extract insights from datasets, improving data-driven decision-making.

2. **Data Anonymization & Privacy**  
   - Gained experience in anonymizing personal data, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.

3. **Database Design & Structuring**  
   - Proposed effective data analysis approaches related to social media and demonstrated the ability to design structured databases for optimal data management.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- **Data Engineering**: Built pipelines to process and analyze datasets, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.  
- **Data Anonymization**: Ensured compliance with data privacy regulations by anonymizing personal data.  
- **Database Design**: Created well-structured databases to efficiently manage and store data.  
- **Data Analysis**: Aggregated and analyzed datasets to provide valuable business insights.  
- **Microsoft Excel**: Utilized Excel for data processing and manipulation.

**Skills Developed:**  
- **APIs**: Gained understanding of working with APIs for data extraction.

# CommonwealthBank_DataScience
I completed the Commonwealth Bank Data Science job simulation on Forage, where I created data engineering pipelines to extract valuable insights from datasets. I learned data anonymization for privacy compliance and designed optimized databases. This experience enhanced my skills in data analysis, database design, and ensuring data privacy.
